  The SGDEX Content Manager simplifies task management for developers
  so they don't have to worry as much about things like Task Nodes
  and the multi-threaded nature of Roku Scene Graph. SGDEX does this
  using ContentHandlers. In order to populate a view, all the developer
  needs to do is provide SGDEX with a some config data to drive that view's 
  ContentHandler(s).
