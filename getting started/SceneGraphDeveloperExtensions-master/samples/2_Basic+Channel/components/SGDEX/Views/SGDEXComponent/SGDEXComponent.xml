            view.theme = {
                textColor: "FF0000FF"
            } -->
        <field id="theme" type="assocarray" onChange="SGDEX_ViewThemeObserver" />

        <!-- updateTheme is used to update view specific theme fields

        Usage is same as [theme](#SGDEXComponent#fields#theme) field but here you should only set field that you want to update
